## Twin-Networks-for-Sequence-Generation

PyTorch implementation for ICLR 2018 accepted paper *Twin Networks: Matching the Future for Sequence Generation* [[pdf]](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BydLzGb0Z) for verifying the results for image captioning on MSCOCO dataset and pixel-by-pixel generation on MNIST.

An analysis of the paper and the reproducibility results on both the datasets are provided in ```Reproducibility_Report.pdf```.

The implementation details are provided in ```ImageCaptioningCOCO``` and ```SequentialMNIST```.
